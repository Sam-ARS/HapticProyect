# Unity Haptic Plugin for Haptic Devices (Unity project)

This plug-in enables the integration of Haptic interaction techniques using C# language in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/), a cross-platform game engine (32 & 64 bits). 

## Authors

The development of this plug-in was performed by:
* **David Escobar-Castillejos** - Ph.D. in Engineering Sciences, Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Mexico.
* **Roberto Alejandro Cardenas Ovando** - Ph.D. in Engineering Sciences, Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Mexico.

## General Overview

This plug-in was created by the Cyber Learning and Data Science Laboratory from the Tecnologico de Monterrey, Campus Mexico City, Mexico. 

The plug-in was developed using C++ and adapting [Chai3d](http://chai3d.org/), which is a powerful cross-platform C++ simulation framework. 

 The plugin has been tested on a Geomagic Touch, SensAble Phantom Omni, and Novint Falcon Haptic Devices. The plug-in is not yet tested on any other devices. However, according to Chai3d's documentation, it also supports the following devices:

* Force Dimension delta.3,6
* Force Dimension omega.3,6,7
* Force Dimension sigma.7
* Geomagic (SensAble/3D-Systems) devices
* Simulated devices
* Custom device integration
